I would like to create a simple python project simulating an animation of a car running up and
down a hill with different road settings, weather settings, and how these different settings will
affect the car speed. Note this project is for beginners/ amatuer Python user, so please keep it
as basic and simple as possible.
1. For the car, the user will need to input its dimensions: length, width, height, weight. Since
this is a simple project, you can treat the car as a rectangle box.
2. For the hill, the length, slope will be up to you
3. For the road settings, there will be two scenarios: smooth and rough. For the smooth
road, there will be no friction, and for rough road, you will need to account for friction.
Friction coefficient is up to you
4. For weather settings, there will be three scenarios: normal, snow, rain. For the normal
road condition, the car will travel with regular speed, for snow, the car will travel with half
speed, as for rain, the car will travel with Â¾ of the speed.
5. Finally, I would like to see the time it took for the car to travel through the hill.
